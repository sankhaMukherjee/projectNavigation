## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a valid Python installation on your system. This has been tested with Python 3.6. It does not assume a particulay version of python, however, it makes no assertions of proper working, either on this version of Python, or on another. 

## Installing

1. Clone this repository to your computer, and create a virtual environment. Note that there is a `Makefile` at the base folder. You will want to run the command `make env` to generate the environment. Do this at the first time you are cloning the repo. The python environment is already copied from the deep reinforced learning repository, and is installed within your environment, when you generate the environment.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Acknowledgments

 - This repo contains a copy of the python environment available [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/python). 
 - Two files [dqn_agent.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/master/dqn/exercise/dqn_agent.py) and [model.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/master/dqn/exercise/model.py) have been used with practically no modification.
 - The solution follows very closely to the solution present for the dqn challenge present [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/dqn/solution/Deep_Q_Network_Solution.ipynb).
